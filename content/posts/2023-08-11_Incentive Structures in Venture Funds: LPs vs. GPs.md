Venture funds are primarily powered by two key participants: **Limited Partners (LPs)** and **General Partners (GPs)**. Each has distinct roles and incentives.

## Limited Partners (LPs)

**Role**: Investors in the fund, providing capital for investments.

**Incentives**:
- **Capital Returns**: Earn returns from portfolio exits and distributions.
- **Preferred Return**: Often, LPs have a "hurdle rate" ensuring they receive a minimum return before GPs take their profit share.

## General Partners (GPs)

**Role**: Managers of the fund, making investment decisions and managing portfolio companies.

**Incentives**:
- **Management Fees**: Typically 1.5% to 2.5% of the fund's total assets or committed capital.
- **Carried Interest**: A share of the fund's profits, usually around 20%, earned after LPs get their preferred return.
- **Co-investment**: GPs sometimes invest their own money alongside LPs, aligning interests further.

In essence, while LPs are driven by potential returns, GPs are incentivized through management fees and a share in profits.
