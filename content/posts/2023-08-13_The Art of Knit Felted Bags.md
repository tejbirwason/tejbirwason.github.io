Today I learned about the fascinating craft of creating knit felted bags. These unique accessories are crafted through a combination of knitting and felting, resulting in a dense, matted fabric that's both beautiful and durable.

## Knitting
First, an oversized bag is knitted using wool or a wool-blend yarn, as these materials felt the best.

## Felting
Next, the bag is subjected to a felting process, using either a washing machine or manual hand felting. This involves moisture, heat, and agitation to interlock the fibers, giving the bag its distinctive appearance.

## Drying and Shaping
The felted bag is then reshaped and allowed to dry, often stretched over a form or stuffed to achieve the desired shape.

## Attributes
- **Durability**: The felting process adds sturdiness.
- **Appearance**: Felted bags offer a unique texture.
- **Versatility**: You can create different shapes and sizes, adding embellishments as desired.

## Care
Care for these bags involves hand washing in cold water and air drying to maintain their form.
