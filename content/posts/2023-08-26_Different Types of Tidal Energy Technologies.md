Tidal energy is harnessed from the natural rise and fall of ocean tides. Here are the main types of tidal energy technologies:

1. **Tidal Barrages**: Dams built across estuaries with sluice gates and turbines. Water is allowed into the estuary as the tide rises and then released through turbines to generate electricity as the tide ebbs.

2. **Tidal Stream Generators**: Devices that capture the kinetic energy of moving water as the tide ebbs and flows. Similar to wind turbines but placed in areas with strong tidal currents.

3. **Dynamic Tidal Power (DTP)**: A concept involving a very long dam built perpendicular to the coast in areas with strong tidal currents. The difference in water levels on either side of the dam generates electricity as the tide ebbs and flows.

4. **Oscillating Water Column (OWC)**: A partially submerged chamber with an opening below the waterline. As waves or tidal currents enter the chamber, the water level inside rises and falls, compressing and decompressing the air above, which drives a turbine to generate electricity.

5. **Tidal Lagoons**: Created by building a wall around a section of the coastline or offshore area with a high tidal range. Turbines in the wall generate electricity as the tide ebbs and flows.
