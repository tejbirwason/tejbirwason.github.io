I've been shopping for an electric vehicle (EV), and  encountered terms like NEDC and WLTP. These acronyms stand for testing procedures that estimate a vehicle's range and efficiency. Here's what they mean and why WLTP is the more reliable standard today.

## What was NEDC?
The **New European Driving Cycle (NEDC)** was the older standard used until 2017. It included:

- Urban (ECE-15) and extra-urban cycles.
- Lower average speeds for testing.
- A short total test time of around 20 minutes.
- Few gear changes and mild acceleration/deceleration profiles.
- Ideal temperature conditions (20-30Â°C) without considering real-world variations.
- Ignored additional power-consuming features like AC or heated seats.

## The Advancement to WLTP
The **Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP)** is a newer global standard introduced to give a more accurate measure of a car's performance. The WLTP brings improvements such as:

- Longer and more realistic driving cycles.
- Higher average and maximum speeds.
- Dynamic phases with various driving situations (urban, suburban, highway).
- Realistic gear shifts.
- Consideration for colder temperatures and how they affect performance.
- Accounting for vehicle options that affect power consumption.
- Testing at different load states.

## Why WLTP Offers a Better Comparison
The transition to WLTP aims to ensure that the lab testing conditions more accurately reflect the on-road performance of vehicles. This means that when you look at a car's specifications:

- The range and efficiency figures are more in line with what you can expect in real-world driving conditions.
- You can better compare vehicles since the data reflects the impact of optional extras and different driving styles.

In short, if you're comparing EVs, **WLTP figures are the ones to trust**. They offer a more realistic picture of what your driving experience will entail, particularly in terms of range and energy consumption.
